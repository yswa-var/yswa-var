I am a hiker blending technology with financial markets to create something crazy. My tools are in Python, automation, and data analysis. John Wickly focused on tools like backtesting libraries, trading indicators, and stock screening systems.  

💡 **What I do:**  
- Build frameworks for **financial data analysis** and **trading systems**.  
- Create tools for **sector rotation analysis** and **options backtesting**.  
- Automate workflows to simplify complex financial processes.  

🌟 **Highlights:**  
- Creator of [EasyBT](https://github.com/yswa-var/EasyBt), a Python library for effortless backtesting.  
- Developed [ObsiWatchlist](https://github.com/yswa-var/obsiWatchlist) for customizable stock charting and analysis.  
- Enthusiast for **automation, trading systems**, and open-source projects.  

🌱 **Beyond Code:**  
I enjoy writing blogs, trekking Himalayan trails, and exploring the wilderness. Check out my thoughts on [Medium](https://medium.com/@yashaswa).
