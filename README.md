### Journey
I started as a 3d-blender-artist/dev [art-portfolio](https://yasv.artstation.com/) that's what sparked my respect for nft-web3-crypto world, after that I shifted to python for algo-trading did 3 internships (micro-teams) in this field learned a lot about production api's (fastAPI), data engineering pipelines and bliss in hard work.

Then stared working as a full-time software developer (mostly on data pipelines, LMS infra, notification system and some automations) at a mid level startup that got dissolved after a year.

Now i'm learning web3 infra development mainly using typescript-rust-anchor-solana, 

I'm all in on theNetworkState dream.

I'm actively looking for opportunities, let's have a chat yswa.var@gmail.com
